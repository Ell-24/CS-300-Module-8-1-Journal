CS-300 analysis of runtime and memory of data structure and working code to load, print and search course file

The problem being addressed in this course was to choose which data structure would be best to manage and interact 
the contents within the course file. The numerous options and tasks were specified and it was a matter of 
determining which structure would handle those tasks the best and implementing that structure properly.

Approaching this problem largely consisted of learning and comparing. First step was to learn each specific data 
structure. Each structure had there own unique way of storing data with their own specific funtions and
necessities. Then it was a matter of comparing the different structures. Each data structure has their own
advantages and disadvantages. No structure will be outright better than another, its a matter of tradeoffs
and when a specific advantage is needed. This is why its important to understand the numerous data structures.
Utilizing the wrong strucutre will have detremental effects to the systems capabilities and performance. 
Once a proper structure was determined, it was then implemented into the code propery.

Many of my roadblocks revolved around my knowledge and inexperience with the numerous data strucutres. Learning was
primary way I overcame my numerous roadblocks. I had to utilize my course and learning material very closely and 
get an in depth understanding of each data structure. Once I had the adequate knowledge I was able to properly 
understand which structure was more prefferable and how to implment them within my assignments.

My work has gave me new tools that I can utilize when approaching software. I now have the ability to identify
which data structure would be appropriate for which situation. I have a deeper understanding of whats going on 
and have stronger skills to optimize and streghten software.

With a deeper understanding of important aspects and the differences between the numerous data structures I am able 
to identigy when a structure is being implemented and when the appropraite structure is being utilized. With this
I can give a better explanation to my work. I can then improve it by focusing on specific areas or chanfing my 
approaches with different structures. This all directly improve readibility, maintainability and adaptability.
